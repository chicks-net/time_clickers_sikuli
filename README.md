# Time Clickers automation with Sikuli

Automate time warps in [Time Clickers](http://store.steampowered.com/app/385770/) with [Sikuli](http://www.sikuli.org/).

## Setup

To get this to work you should

* be on a Mac (otherwise the `switchApp` will probably break) - patches welcomed :bowtie:
* run Time Clickers in a Window at 1024x768

## Scripts

* [TimeWarp.sikuli](https://rawgit.com/chicks-net/time_clickers_sikuli/master/TimeWarp.sikuli/TimeWarp.html) - handle a Time Warp
* [UpgradeEverybody.sikuli](https://rawgit.com/chicks-net/time_clickers_sikuli/master/UpgradeEverybody.sikuli/UpgradeEverybody.html) - upgrade all team members evenly
* [UpgradeStepped.sikuli](https://rawgit.com/chicks-net/time_clickers_sikuli/master/UpgradeStepped.sikuli/UpgradeStepped.html) - get team members into step wise fashion then upgrade them evenly

## Technical notes

I did this:

* on a Mac running OSX 10.10.5
* with SikulixIDE 1.10
